# WSN_tide_clock

This is a simple tide clock consisting of an Arduino, 
real time clock, OLED I2C 128x64 display with a ssd1306 
controller. The software includes my tide calculator
libraries http://github.com/millerlp/Tide_calculator 
and the simple ASCII library for OLED displays available
at https://github.com/greiman/SSD1306Ascii.
